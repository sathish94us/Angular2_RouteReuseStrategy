    Globalization is the spreading of anything worldwide. However, generally it is the process of globalizing products, businesses, technologies, philosophies, etc all through the world. It is the creation of a successful interconnected marketplace without any limitation of time zone and national boundaries. The most common and clear example of globalization is the spread of McDonalds restaurants all around the world. It became so successful in the worldwide markets because of its effective strategy adapting the culture of different countries in their menus to suit local tastes of people. We can say it as internationalization which is a great combination of both, the globalization and the localization.

It is very hard to decide whether the revolution of global marketplace is beneficial or harmful to the humanity. It is still a big confusion. However, it is also tough to ignore that globalization has created greater opportunities to people worldwide. It has changed status and way of living of people in the society to a great extent. It is hugely benefiting the developing nations by providing various developmental opportunities. If we take it positively, it may eradicate the regional diversity and establish a homogenized world culture. It is supported by the information technology and show huge interaction and integration among businesses, companies, government and people of various countries. Globalization has positively and negatively affected the tradition, culture, political system, economic development, lifestyle, prosperity, etc.
